<p style="font-size:18px">This is an hackaton project that mix almost every aspect of our learning materials up to this date in 13 weeks of Bootcamp.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px">The project is based on <span style="font-weight: bold;">FLASK</span>, and for building it we have used:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li>SQL database with one to many relationship</li>
  <li>JSON based database</li>
  <li>5 different API sources</li>
  <li>BOOTSTRAP</li>
  <li>iQuery for autocomplete</li>
  <li>Dynamic website base  user location</li>
  <li>A user dashboard with the possibility to update information</li>
  <li>And some vanilla CSS styling for building our self made widgets and page layouts</li>
</ul>

### About the project: 
<p>
The main goal of our project was to create a website that will give us the opportunity to cover all of the latest learning materials in our Bootcamp, for that reason the project contain lots of other projects which helped us get the final result.
<br>
While styling may vary from one to another, when looking at our backend, it is clear to see that we have managed to achieve our goal.
<br>
<br>
We have decided to use a news portal for our project, as it gave us the opportunity to put the user on the front, this is because, when searching for a specific news type on the website, it will remember those specific results and next time the user will log in new results base on the same topic will show on the screen first.
<br>
The same thing will be with our widgets which show weather based on user location, football matches results based on the country and the Covid widget will show information based on country.
<br>
For more Trading information, there is a dedicated trading section that is available once logged in which saves the stocks the user added to show in the future for being able to compare stats between different dates.
<br>
Users can also go to the personal dashboard to see their profile information and update it if necessary

### user info:
<p style="color: red;">Because of our use of a "FREE KEY" for the API's used on the website, we needed to make sure we are avoiding errors.
<br>
To do so, when having more than 5 requests from the Stocks API a default message of "API timeout" will show instead of the relevant information, this is due to a maximum of 5 requests per minute.
<br>
The same is done with the Football API which will show the information of the Israeli league as default by loading it as the website starts running to avoid any request error, if the number of requests is under the limit it will continue to show information base on user location.
