<p style="font-size:18px">This is an hackaton project that mixes almost everything we have learned in 13 weeks of Bootcamp.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px">The project is based on <span style="font-weight: bold;">FLASK</span>, and for building it we used:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li>SQL database, with one to many relationships.</li>
  <li>JSON based database.</li>
  <li>5 different API's sources.</li>
  <li>BOOTSTRAP.</li>
  <li>jQuery for search autocomplete.</li>
  <li>Dynamic website, based on users locations.</li>
  <li>A user dashboard with a possibility to update information.</li>
  <li>And some vanilla CSS styling for building our self made widgets and page layouts.</li>
</ul>

### About the project: 
<p>
The main goal of our project was to create a website that will give us the opportunity to cover all of our latest learning subjects in our Bootcamp, for that reason the project contains a lot of other projects which helped us get the final result.
<br>
While frontend styling taste may vary from one to another, when looking at our backend work, it is clear to see that we have managed to achieve our goal.
<br>
<br>
We have decided to use a news portal for our project, as it gave us the opportunity to put the user in the front, this is because, when searching for a specific news topic on the website, it will remember those specific results and next time when the user will log in, new results base on the same topic will show on the first page.
<br>
The same appliace to our different widgets, that show:
<br>Weather based on user location.
<br>Football fixtures based on users countries.
<br>Covid widget will also be based on users countries.
<br>
For more Football or Trading information, there are dedicated Football and Trading pages.
<br>
Once logged in, can be access by clicking on the widget itself.
<br>The trading page, contains the users saved stocks to their personal profile so as to enable users to compare information between different dates.
<br>
Users can also go to their personal dashboard, to see their profile information and update it if necessary.

### Important:
<p>Because of our use of a "FREE KEY" for all of the API's, we needed to make sure we are avoiding errors.
<br>
To do so, when having more than 5 requests from the Stocks API a default message of "API timeout" will show instead of the relevant information, this is due to a maximum of 5 requests per minute when using the "FREE KEY".
<br>
The same is done with the Football API which will show the information of the Israeli league as default by loading it when the website starts running to avoid any requests error, if the number of requests is under the limit it will continue to show information based on user location.
